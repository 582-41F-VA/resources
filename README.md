## Installation

### Node and NPM

You are strongly encouraged to install Node through your package manager
(Scoop, Homebrew, etc.). NPM comes pre-installed with Node.

### React

This course uses Vite to scaffold your React development environment.
You will find the instructions to do so [here][Vite instructions]. Note
that `npm create vite@latest` will create a new directory for your
project. If your are already in a project's directory, you can install
React in the working directory by appending a dot: `npm create
vite@latest .`
